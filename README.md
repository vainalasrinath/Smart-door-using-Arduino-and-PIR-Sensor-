# Smart-door-using-Arduino-and-PIR-Sensor-
An Automatic Door Opener System is a project based on PIR Sensor and Arduino, which automatically opens and closes the door by detecting a person or object.
You might have seen Automatic Door Opener Systems at shopping malls, cinemas, hospitals etc. where, as soon as a person approaches the door (at about 2 or 3 feet), the door automatically slides open. And after some time (about 5 to 10 seconds), the door closes
Such Automatic Door Opener Systems are very useful as you do not need a person to standby the door and open it whenever a guest comes. Also, since the doors are opened and closed only when a person approaches the door, there is significantly less loss of air conditioning.
So, in order to understand the potential of this concept, we have implemented a simple Automatic Door Opener System using Arduino and PIR Sensor

COMPONENTS REQUIRED
1:Arduino UNO
2:PIR Sensor 
3:Servo motor
4:Breadboard  
5:Connecting Wires  
6:Power Supply 

WORKING
The working of the Automatic Door Opener System using Arduino and PIR When the PIR Sensor detects any motion of a person, its Data OUT Pin will become HIGH. As this pin is connected to the Arduino, it will detect this HIGH Signal and understands that there is person approaching the door.
Arduino then immediately activates the SERVO Motor Driver module to open the door. After some time (about 2 to 5 seconds in this project), the Arduino will once again activate the Motor Drive to close the door. 

APPLICATIONS
Arduino based Automatic Door Opener System is a very useful project as it enables you to understand the concept of such automatic door opener systems and how they work.
These systems are already being used in many places like malls, theatres and hospitals.
You can implement this Arduino based project at you home in Garage Door Openers, toilet cover openers, Office door openers, etc.
